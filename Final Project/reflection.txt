The source bodies of text chosen were from The Office (Season 5, Episode 13 - Stress Relief) and Brooklyn 99 (Season 5, Episode 14 - The Box).
Since both shows were directed by the same person, we chose to compare another show written by the same person. That show is Parks and Recreation
(Season 5, Episode 14 - Leslie and Ben). Based on the code written, it was found that s5ep14 of Parks was more likely to have come from s5ep13 of The Office.
However, we want to note that the comparison scores were very similar.

The following is the result of our code:

scores for theoffice: [-22494.67289561892, -7094.020479452857, -22131.354662422735, -89.62913312132817, -209.09834768368057]
scores for brooklyn99: [-22507.860501751013, -7102.596567554924, -22082.99159079336, -93.13219677928467, -213.15510418628705]
parks is more likely to have come from theoffice

We compared words, word lengths, stems, sentence lengths, and our own choice - conjunction frequencies.
We believe our text classification program works quite well. It is adequate for use. Of course, our stemming program was only limited to the removal
of 'most' suffixes and no prefixes. We tried our best to get as many suffix scenarios as possible, but nonetheless, the ambiguity of the English
language proves to be a most difficult trial for us to completely and fully devise a true 'stemming' program. In terms of improval,
further cleanups, additions, and tweaks to the stemming program would be the main focus in a future attempt at this program. Furthermore, it would be
beneficial to utilize more options for comparing bodies of text.
