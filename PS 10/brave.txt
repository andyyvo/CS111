You can be amazing.
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug.
You can be the outcast.
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love.
Or you can start speaking up.

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
when they settle 'neath your skin.
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
sometimes a shadow wins.

But I wonder what would happen if you
say what you wanna say
and let the words fall out.
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
with what you want to say
and let the words fall out.
Honestly I wanna see you be brave.

I just wanna see you.
I just wanna see you.
I just wanna see you.
I wanna see you be brave.

Everybody's been there.
Everybody's been stared down by the enemy,
fallen for the fear
and done some disappearing.
Bow down to the mighty.
Don't run, just stop holding your tongue.

Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live.
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in.
Show me how big your brave is.

And since your history of silence
won't do you any good,
did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty.
Why don't you tell them the truth?
